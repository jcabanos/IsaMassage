    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>What should I expect from my first session?</h2>
    <p>
      The therapist will arrive 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time to set up the treatment area. The session will start with a quick client intake and assessment. A customization and breakdown of the massage will be established and
      followed by a brief medical history intake.
      The therapist will then step away from the treatment area to offer client privacy while you disrobe.
      During the massage communication between you and the therapist is encouraged. Questions regarding your session or if you would like any adjustments to be made can be asked at any point in during the massage.
      Once finished, payment will be collected and a follow-up session is to be scheduled.
    </p>
    <h2>How should I prepare for a massage?</h2>
    <p>
      No need to do any major preparation before a massage. Just make sure to hydrate and shower at least 24 hours prior.

      Preparing a space in a common living area (no bedrooms) for the massage table is the most preparation necessary. The area where the massage table is to be placed, if wood or tile, should be swept of any debris to prevent slipping. Surrounding
      the perimeter of the table, any items must be cleared so the therapist can comfortably move from either side.

      Please ensure any pets such as cats or dogs are placed in another room aside from the treatment area to best ensure any unknown allergens remain impartial to the therapist.
    </p>
    <h2>What's your cancellation policy?</h2>
    <p>
      Should you need to cancel or reschedule, a 24 hour notice is required. Any cancellations with less than 24 hour notice are subject to cancellation fee of 50% of the scheduled service.
    </p>
    <h2>What form of payment do you accept?</h2>
    <p>
      Cash, Venmo, and Cashapp are all accepted as different forms of payment. Payment will be collected at the end of every session. Additional fees, such as travel or cancellation fees may be applied at that time.
